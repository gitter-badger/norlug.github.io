<h3>Meeting Notes!</h3>
<p>Last nights turn out was small, but it was an enjoyable evening. While the actual presentation got somewhat sidetracked by playing Super Tux Cart, everyone had a lot of fun. We'll keep this presentation around for a future meeting when lots of newer Linux users join us!</p>
<p>If you want to check out the slides, they are posted below</p>
