Congratulations to the Fedora team for a sucessful release of Fedora 20! In recognition of this achievement, tonights Coffee House Coders will be combined with a release party! I will provide a Fedora 20 install disk and USB drive for anyone interested doing a new install, or upgrading an existing. I will also provide a mobile hotspot incase the Hideaway's WIFI speeds slow down.
