Aprils monthly meeting will be to celebrate the release of the next Long Term Support (LTS) of Ubuntu code named Trusty Tahr!

We will be meeting at Goodbye Blue Monday Coffeehouse as a change of scenery. Install CDs and USB sticks will be available for anyone interested in testing out Ubuntu 14.04!

If you have ever been interested in testing out Linux, but worried to take the plunge, this is a great opportunity to come test it out and get it installed with knowledgeable people around to help!
