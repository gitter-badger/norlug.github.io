<h3>Announcement!</h3>
This month, we Adam Ness will be talking to us about Vagrant. Vagrant is a computer software for creating and configuring virtual development environments. It can be seen as a wrapper around virtualization software such as VirtualBox, KVM, VMware and around configuration management software such as Ansible, Chef, Salt or Puppet.

We will be meeting at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/313+1%2F2+Division+St+S,+Northfield,+MN+55057/@44.4569015,-93.1596518,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87f653c708dab4b3:0x7826288e9b2cdb61">SPUR Coworking Space</a> on April 23rd, 2015 at 7:00 pm.
