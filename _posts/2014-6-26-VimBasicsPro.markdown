<h3>Meeting Notes!</h3>
Vim Basics like a Pro was a major success! We had a record showing of people attend since our revival late last year. The presentation prompted quite a bit of conversation, including some really interesting history of vim, bash, grep and so many other tools that we all use on a daily basis. If your interested in viewing the slides from the presentation, check out the link below. The resources slides have quite a few links to various references, articles, and even a web based game designed to teach you vim!
