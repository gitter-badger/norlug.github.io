Norlug has a new website! Check us out at <a href="http://www.norlug.org" target="_blank">www.norlug.org</a>. The design of the website is inspired by my personal website <a href="http://www.mathomaste.ch" target="_blank">here</a>, and a coffee house coder groups website from the Detroit, MI area. Check out their site <a href="http://royaloak.coffeehousecoders.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
