Norlug has had a solid start so far at our weekly Coffee House Coders meetups. Thank you to all who have been able to make it out!

In preparation for the new year, we will be holding a planning meeting on December 19, Location TBD. There will be free pizza! We will be discussing several key items including technical meetings, website design and content, additional events (hackathon, release party, etc) and anything else members would like to discuss. In order to get a head count for the pizza order, please RSVP via our <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c85d8g1h8fcdbi1k6k805u07gr0?authkey=CM6NkP2x-K2E8gE" target="_blank">G+ event</a>, our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NORLUG/events/151517302/" target="_blank">meetup event</a>, or by replying to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/norlug/368FD6bu9co" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.
