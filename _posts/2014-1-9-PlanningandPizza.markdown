We will be having a planning meeting on Thursday January 9th from 7-10 at B & L Pizza. The goal of this meeting will be to set us up for a strong 2014. NORLUG will provide pizza for all attendees. There will be both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. If you have any additional dietary requests, please let us know ahead of time.
