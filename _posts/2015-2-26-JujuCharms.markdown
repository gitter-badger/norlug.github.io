<h3>Announcement!</h3>

Matt Bruzek from Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu,  will be coming to talk to us about Juju charms.

Juju is a system that provisions and orchestrates across a variety of cloud environments.  Juju allows you to deploy best practice services called "charms" to virtual machine instances.  The presentation will include a demo of the Juju technology and some of its tooling.

We will be meeting at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/313+1%2F2+Division+St+S,+Northfield,+MN+55057/@44.4569015,-93.1596518,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87f653c708dab4b3:0x7826288e9b2cdb61">SPUR Coworking Space</a> on February 26th, 2015 at 7:00 pm.
