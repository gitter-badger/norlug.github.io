<h3>Meeting Notes!</h3>
There was a lot of interest and enthusiasm with this months topic. Covering everything from privacy and security concerns. There where quite a few jokes thrown around, and an almost failed demo due to a lack of an HDMI -> VGA adapter. There was also a brief lightning talk about the tor network, and the idea of black sites. Very cool stuff all around. Below is a link to the slides from the main presentation.
