NORLUG will be hosting its first technical meetup on March 20, 2014 since its revival. What better way to kick it off than to talk about one of the most exciting pieces of technology to have come out of 2012. A low cost, low power credit card sized computer, the Raspberry Pi!

Adam Ness and Marc Thomas have both volunteered to give a talk on how they use their Raspberry Pi.

Marc will give a brief overview of what the Raspberry Pi is, and how people have been using it since its debut. His main presentation will be a starters talk on how to set up a Raspberry Pi as a remote file server using Arch Linux. Some of the tools he will be discussing include ssh, scp, screen, weechat-curses, port mapping, port forwarding, and some DNS magic.

Adam will be showing off some hardware hacks that you can do when you combine a Raspberry Pi with an Arduino. If you've every been curious about custom home automation, then you'll definitely want to see this!
