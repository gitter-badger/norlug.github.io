Check out the newest addition to our website, the resources tab! The resources tab will be a collection of local Linux and FOSS resources, including other Linux and FOSS focused user groups, computer sales and repair shops that sell and/or service Linux machines, Linux related job postings, and more! Check back often as the content will be updated regularly.
