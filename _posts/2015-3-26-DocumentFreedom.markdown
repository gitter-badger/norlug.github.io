<h3>Announcement!</h3>

March 25th is Document Freedom day. So in light of that, lets plan on a discussion around document freedom. I'll put together some video's about document freedom that we can watch. If anyone has any lightning talks they would like to do, this would be a great month to bring them! It will likely be a shorter meeting, but we will still have the social hour at Basils afterwards.

We will be meeting at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/313+1%2F2+Division+St+S,+Northfield,+MN+55057/@44.4569015,-93.1596518,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87f653c708dab4b3:0x7826288e9b2cdb61">SPUR Coworking Space</a> on March 26th, 2015 at 7:00 pm. Our traditional social hour will follow the meeting at Basils Pizzaria.
