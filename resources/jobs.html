        <p><strong>NORLUG Community</strong>
        <p>All job listings here are curated by members of NORLUG. Company's and job's listed here may not always reflect their current status. This section is to act as a starting place for people seeking employment with local companies and to provide contacts of companies/recruiters who have had Linux jobs past or present.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p><strong>Recruiters</strong></p>
        <p>If you are recruiting for a company with Linux positions, or know of companies seeking Linux professionals, please email <a href="mailto:northfieldlug@gmail.com?Subject=Job Listing Request" target="_top">northfieldlug@gmail.com</a> to get in touch with a NORLUG organizer and have your content added or updated. After your listings have been added to our page, we will reach out to you periodically (every 3 - 6 months or so) to update our listings. If we are unable to contact you at that time, or if your company no longer has Linux positions, we will remove the listing from our site.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Stuff</strong></p>
        <p>Listings may be removed at any time at the discretion of the NORLUG organizers. Companys and jobs listed here are done so under good faith and without any expectation of monetary or services exchange.</p>
