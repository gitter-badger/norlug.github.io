                <p class="post">NORLUG is undergoing a revival! NORLUG was originally founded in 2001 and was active until around 2008. Activity slowed down as many of the established members had relocated. Now, several years later, it's time to revive the group! If your a former member, come by one of our meetups and reintroduce yourself. If your new, come by and see what we have to offer! Whether your a professional, a student, or just an enthusiast, there's something for everyone!</p>
