        <h2> <a href="news/">Website Updates</a></h2>
        <p class="post">The NORLUG website has undergone a few improvements to become more mobile, and small screen friendly. All the cards now reposition themselves and resize properly on smaller screens. We have done away with the navigation at the topic and replaced it with a very slick boarder menu which can be opened by clicking/tapping on the icon up on the left. We have also added archive sections for meetings and news, so now it will be easier to find meeting notes or news for events in the past.</p>
