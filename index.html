        Get together for good company, coffee and computers. Bring personal projects you are working on. It can be anything from coding, graphic design, video editing, etc as long as it's something you've been wanting to do that maybe haven't been able to find the time for. It doesn't have to be specific to Linux. Mac and Window's users won't be shunned :). Share your experiences and your knowledge. Have some coffee and talk with like minded individuals! Feel free to network, bring any jobs you know about, or people you know are looking for jobs.

                <p class="post">NORLUG is undergoing a revival! NORLUG was originally founded in 2001 and was active until around 2008. Activity slowed down as many of the established members had relocated. Now, several years later, it's time to revive the group! If your a former member, come by one of our meetups and reintroduce yourself. If your new, come by and see what we have to offer! Whether your a professional, a student, or just an enthusiast, there's something for everyone!</p>
